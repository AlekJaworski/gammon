# gamrs

Generalised Additive Models in Rust — clean-room reimplementation built on
six composable trait layers (`Basis`, `BasisTransform`, `Loss`/`Link`/`VarianceFn`,
`InnerSolver`, `ScoreDerivatives`, `OuterSolver`). Designed for parity with
R's `mgcv`.

**Status: beta (v0.11).** Fastest where wall time matters — large n and
high basis dimension (up to ~2.3× at n=1M and ~15× at k=50 vs
`mgcv_rust` 0.23), competitive-to-slower on tiny fits, with a known
multi-smooth-NegBin gap; see [Performance](#performance) for the honest
breakdown. `mgcv` R-parity on µ across all ten families. Multi-smooth
additive (`y ~ s(x0) + s(x1)`),
n-margin tensor products (`te(x0, x1, …)` / `ti(…)`) and thin-plate splines
(`s(x0, x1, bs="tp")`) all ship. NegBin and Tweedie fit multi-smooth, with
Tweedie offering both profile-p (`tw()`) and fixed-p (`Tweedie(p)`).

## Install

```bash
pip install gamrs            # base wheel
pip install gamrs[quantile]  # + scipy for SHASH-calibrated quantile fits
```

## Quickstart

```python
from gamrs import Gam, CrTerm, TeTerm

# Single 1-D smooth, Gaussian
g = Gam(family="gaussian").fit(X, y)
mu  = g.predict(X)
mu, lo, hi = g.predict_ci(X, level=0.95)

# Multi-smooth additive
g = Gam(terms=[CrTerm("x0", k=10), CrTerm("x1", k=15)]).fit(df, df["y"])

# Tensor product
g = Gam(terms=[TeTerm(cols=("x0", "x1"), k=(5, 5))]).fit(df, df["y"])

# Large-n GLM — switch to the bam()-style fREML optimiser. Ported to the
# GLM envelope driver only; elsewhere it warns and fits on REML instead.
g = Gam(family="poisson", method="fREML").fit(X_big, y_big)
```

## Families

All ten families land 1-D parity against `mgcv`:

| Family          | Link     | Inner solver | Outer optimiser     | Parity (µ rel-err) |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Gaussian        | identity | one-Cholesky | 1-D Newton          | ~3e-6              |
| Bernoulli       | logit    | PIRLS        | 1-D Newton          | ~1e-3              |
| Poisson         | log      | PIRLS        | 1-D Newton          | ~8e-5              |
| QuasiPoisson    | log      | PIRLS        | 1-D Newton (prof φ) | ~2e-4              |
| QuasiBinomial   | logit    | PIRLS        | 1-D Newton (prof φ) | ~7e-5              |
| Gamma           | log      | PIRLS        | 1-D Newton (prof φ) | ~2e-2              |
| InverseGaussian | log      | PIRLS        | 1-D Newton (prof φ) | ~3e-4              |
| NegBin          | log      | PIRLS        | ρ-Newton + profile-θ | ~9e-7             |
| Tweedie         | log      | PIRLS        | 3-D joint Newton    | ~5e-3              |
| TDist (`scat`)  | identity | PIRLS        | 3-D joint Newton    | ~4e-4              |
| Ocat            | logit    | gam.fit5     | joint β + threshold | smoke              |
| Quantile (ELF)  | identity | Armijo BT    | ρ-Newton (per term) | qgam OOS ~1.00×    |

Multi-smooth (`s(x0) + s(x1) + …`) ships with `mgcv` R parity tests for
Gaussian / Bernoulli / Poisson / QuasiPoisson / QuasiBinomial / Gamma /
InvGauss / NegBin / Tweedie / scat. scat / TDist multi-smooth now has mgcv
reference parity tests too — 2-D µ rel-err ~5.7e-4, 3-D ~2.2e-3, with σ̂²
matching mgcv to ~0.1% (`tests/parity_additive_scat.rs`,
`scripts/r/gen_scat_multismooth_fixtures.R`). Those bounds tightened 8-16× in
0.13.0 when a spurious rank adjustment came out of scat's REML score; the same
release adds `tests/parity_scat_tf9963.rs`, a real-data lock against all three
mgcv arms (`gam`+REML, `bam`+REML, `bam`+fREML). Quantile/ELF now fits
multi-smooth additive too (`y ~ s(x0) + s(x1) + …` via the `terms=` arg of
`fit_quantile`): on a 2-D additive heteroskedastic split its out-of-sample
pinball loss matches `qgam` to within ±0.6% at τ ∈ {0.1, 0.5, 0.9}
(`scripts/r/gen_quantile_multismooth_fixture.R`,
`test_parity_multismooth.py::test_additive_quantile_oos_parity`).

For a *coherent* set of quantiles, `fit_quantile_lss` fits the conditional
distribution by its location μ(x) and scale σ(x) and derives every quantile
as `q_τ(x) = μ(x) + σ(x)·z_τ` — the mgcv `gaulss`/`shash` view. One fit serves
all τ, the bands never cross, and `shape="shash"` captures skew/kurtosis.
Matches mgcv `gaulss` OOS pinball to within ~1% on a heteroskedastic 2-D split
(`scripts/r/gen_quantile_lss_fixture.R`).

### GAMLSS — Gaussian location-scale (`gaulss`)

`fit_gaulss(X, y, mu_terms=…, sigma_terms=…)` is the first GAMLSS
(multi-linear-predictor) family: it fits `y ~ N(μ(x), σ(x)²)` with smooth μ(x)
**and** σ(x) *jointly*. Because the Gaussian location-scale Fisher information
is block-diagonal (μ ⟂ log σ), the joint MLE is an **orthogonal alternation**
of two single-predictor weighted-Gaussian REML fits — reusing the existing fit
stack rather than a dense block-Newton. One fit gives every quantile
(`q_τ = μ + σ·Φ⁻¹(τ)`, no crossing). It recovers mgcv `gaulss`'s μ̂/σ̂ to
RMSE ~3e-4 / ~1e-3 and its OOS pinball to ~0.05%, at ~70× the speed (n=800).
Unlike the two-stage `fit_quantile_lss`, μ is reweighted by 1/σ²(x) each pass —
the joint-MLE efficiency gain. This is the seam for the wider GAMLSS class
(`shash`, `gevlss`): non-orthogonal families extend the same alternation.

### GAMLSS — sinh-arcsinh (`shash`)

`fit_shash(X, y, mu_terms=…, tau_terms=…, eps_terms=…, phi_terms=…)` fits the
**first non-orthogonal** GAMLSS family — all four sinh-arcsinh parameters as
smooths, *jointly*: location μ(x), log-scale τ(x) (`σ = exp τ`), skewness ε(x),
and log-kurtosis φ(x). Because shash's Fisher information couples the predictors
(unlike `gaulss`), β for all four is solved together by a **dense penalised
block-Newton**, under **outer REML/LAML** with an **analytic gradient** (third
derivatives → `d log|Hp|/dρ`). One fit yields every quantile
(`predict_quantile`, the R `.shashQf` inverse-CDF) plus `predict_params` →
(μ, σ, ε, δ). It recovers mgcv `gam(…, family=shash, bs="cr")` to **~1e-6** (η,
smoothing params, EDF, quantiles) and fits Gaussian, skewed, and heavy-tailed
data alike. Distinct from the two-stage `fit_quantile_lss(shape="shash")` (one
global shape) — this is the genuine joint GAMLSS. *(v1: one smooth term per
predictor.)* Term specs use the same form as `fit_additive`, e.g.
`mu_terms=[CrTerm(0, k=10)]`, `tau_terms=[CrTerm(1, k=10)]`, `eps_terms=[]`.

Multi-smooth Ocat now has an mgcv reference parity test
(`tests/parity_additive_scat.rs`'s ocat sibling in
`test_parity_multismooth.py::test_additive_ocat_parity`,
`scripts/r/gen_ocat_multismooth_fixtures.R`): on a well-posed
noisy-latent DGP gamrs and `mgcv` `ocat(R=4)` both converge cleanly and
agree on `predict_proba` to ~1.8e-3 mean abs / 98% class agreement.

v0.10 ports the full mgcv R outer-Newton stabilisation stack (smart
θ-init from category frequencies, diagonal Hessian preconditioning,
Gill-Murray-Wright eigen-fix, subset Newton, rank-deficient KKT
convergence check). After the ports, **single- and (well-posed)
multi-smooth ocat converge cleanly**. The residual `converged_=False`
appears only on **near-separable** fixtures (noiseless quantile-cut
categories) where the latent scale wants to blow up — the exact regime
`mgcv` itself either converges to a degenerate θ≈181 solution or aborts
with "inner loop 1; can't correct step size". There gamrs's θ∈(−3,3)
bound keeps it stable (99% accuracy) and the conservative flag is
correct. See `~/ObsidianVault/Projects/gamrs/gamrs - mgcv outer-Newton
stabilisation techniques (port catalogue) 2026-06-03.md` for the
full port story.

## Smooths

- **Single 1-D** — `s(x0)` via `CrTerm` (cubic regression spline default).
- **Additive multi** — `s(x0) + s(x1) + s(x2)`.
- **Tensor product** — `te(x0, x1, …)` via `TeTerm`, `ti(…)` via `TiTerm`,
  any n-margin.
- **Thin-plate** — `s(x0, x1, bs="tp")` via `TpsTerm`.
- **Random effects** — `s(g, bs="re")` via `ReTerm`.
- **Parametric (linear)** — unsmoothed raw column via `ParametricTerm` or
  `predictor_basis_map={"x": "parametric"}` (alias `"linear"`). Use for
  0/1 indicators, counts, or anything you want unpenalised. mgcv R's
  "pterms" block.

## Performance

`gamrs` vs `mgcv_rust` 0.23.2, best-of-7 median wall time after 3 warmup
iters (`>1×` = `gamrs` faster). Reproduce with `scripts/bench_matters.py`.
Numbers below are an i7-8565U (8th-gen, AVX2); the *ratios* are
same-box-comparable but absolute times differ on your hardware.

**gamrs wins at scale.** Single-smooth, k=20 — as n grows the
constant-factor setup overhead amortises and gamrs pulls ahead:

| family    | n=10K | n=100K |  n=1M |
| --------- | ----: | -----: | ----: |
| Gaussian  | 0.58× |  1.49× | 2.27× |
| Poisson   | 0.24× |  1.01× | 1.89× |
| Bernoulli | 0.39× |  1.12× | 1.84× |

It also wins as the basis dimension `k` grows (Gaussian, n=2K): k=10 →
1.7×, k=20 → 4.0×, k=50 → 15×. (Those fits are <2ms — read them as
above-the-noise ratios, not headline wall-time claims.)

**Shape-aware families (n=2K, k=10):**

| family      | speedup | note                                          |
| ----------- | ------: | --------------------------------------------- |
| Tweedie 1-D |   1.93× |                                               |
| ocat 1-D    |   14.5× | mgcv_rust's ocat path is slow by construction |
| ocat 2-D    |   0.69× |                                               |
| NegBin 1-D  |   0.64× |                                               |
| NegBin 2-D  |   0.06× | multi-smooth profile-θ scaling gap (known)    |
| scat 1-D    |   0.58× | <2ms — sub-noise                              |

**Honest aggregate** (16 above-20ms cells across all sweeps): gamrs is
faster in 8 — median 0.89×, geomean 0.83×, range 0.06×–14.5×. The wins
concentrate where wall time actually matters — large n, large k, and
Tweedie/ocat. Tiny fits (<20ms) and multi-smooth NegBin still trail
mgcv_rust; the NegBin multi-smooth slowdown is a known profile-θ scaling
issue under investigation.

scat climbed from v0.10.0's 0.07× to v0.11's ~0.77× (at the 6K-row
profiling fixture) via analytic gradient + Level-2 analytic Hessian +
observed-W PIRLS + warm-start (v0.11.0) and broadcast-expression
conversion + batched-h_diag matmul (v0.11.1). The residual gap is
per-pair Hessian-assembly work at small p.

For GLM families at large n, set `method="fREML"` (mgcv R's `bam()`
equivalent — Wood & Fasiolo 2017 Fellner-Schall multiplicative updates
with single-step IRLS per outer iteration). The defaults are sensible
at small/medium n; the [perf guide](docs/perf.md) covers when to switch.
Fellner-Schall reached the GLM envelope driver only — on the gaussian
closed-form path, the quantile path and the shape-parameter families
(scat / negbin / tweedie / ocat), `method="fREML"` warns and fits on REML.
Both optimise the same REML criterion and damped Newton is the stronger
route to it, so the substitution costs nothing; it is warned about because
until 0.13.0 it happened silently.

### Parallel fits across threads

As of v0.11.7 the fit releases the GIL (PyO3 `py.detach`) for the entire
solve, so independent `Gam.fit(...)` / `fit_quantile(...)` calls run truly
concurrently on a `ThreadPoolExecutor` — no process pool, no pickling of
inputs. When fanning many fits across a thread pool, set
`OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1` so the BLAS backend doesn't oversubscribe cores
against your own threads: on a 6K-row scat fit that turns the pre-0.11.7
0.58× (GIL-bound, serialised) into ~1.95× on 4 worker threads.

## Rust API

```rust
use gamrs::{TermSpec, MarginKind, DesignStrategy};
use ndarray::Array2;

let x: Array2<f64> = /* (n, n_input_dims) */;
let y = /* Array1<f64> */;

let fit = gamrs::fit(gamrs::family::gaussian_identity(), x.view(), y.view(), None, 10)?;

let fit = gamrs::fit_with_design(
    gamrs::family::gaussian_identity(),
    DesignStrategy::Additive { terms: vec![
        TermSpec::Cr { col: 0, k: 10 },
        TermSpec::Cr { col: 1, k: 15 },
    ]},
    x.view(), y.view(), None,
)?;

let fit = gamrs::fit_with_design(
    gamrs::family::gaussian_identity(),
    DesignStrategy::Additive { terms: vec![
        TermSpec::Tensor { col_a: 0, col_b: 1, k_a: 5, k_b: 5,
                           bs_a: MarginKind::Cr, bs_b: MarginKind::Cr },
    ]},
    x.view(), y.view(), None,
)?;

let mu = fit.predict(x.view())?;
```

## Python API

PyO3 bindings + numpy. sklearn-like surface: `fit` / `predict` /
`predict_ci` / `predict_diff` / `vcov_` / `coef_` / `lambda_` /
`edf_` / `fit_stats_`, plus serialize / deserialize and `GamPredictor`
for inference-only deployment.

## Architecture

Trait layering (`src/traits.rs`):

```
Layer 1   Basis              ←  CrBasis, RandomEffectsBasis, TensorProductBasis<A, B>
Layer 1.5 BasisTransform     ←  SumToZero, StableReparam
Layer 2   Loss/Link/Variance ←  10 families (see table above)
Layer 3   InnerSolver        ←  GaussianClosedFormInner, PirlsInner, GamFit5Inner, ArmijoInner
Layer 4   ScoreDerivatives   ←  EnvelopeScore, ShapeAwareEnvelopeScore
Layer 5   OuterSolver        ←  NewtonWithHalving, FellnerSchall
Layer 6   FittedGam          ←  predict, predict_ci, predict_diff, vcov, serialize
```

Outer optimisers (Newton, Fellner-Schall) and per-family tolerances are
selected through `Loss::outer_tuning()` and `Loss::allows_no_refresh()`,
so adding a family is a `Loss` impl, not a fork of the optimiser.

## Versioning

Beta (`0.13.x`). The API is stabilising; minor bumps may carry breaking
changes until the 1.0 surface is locked. All ten families plus Ocat and
Quantile/ELF now fit multi-smooth additive designs.
