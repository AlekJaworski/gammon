///
/// **Stability caveat**: GMW takes larger steps in formerly-indefinite
/// directions, which only makes sense AFTER the Hessian has been
/// diagonally preconditioned (so the eigenvalue spectrum is uniform
/// across coordinates). Calling GMW on a raw Hessian with wildly
/// different coordinate scales (e.g. ρ and θ axes for scat) over-steps
/// in the high-curvature directions and breaks convergence. Pair with
/// the preconditioning step in the Newton driver.
///
/// Used by the joint Newton in `outer.rs` (preconditioned) and the
/// ρ-only Newton in `profile_shape.rs` (1-D, so preconditioning is
