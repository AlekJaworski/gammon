//! `scat` where a shape axis saturates — the regime behind the 0.14.x
//! non-convergence reports, end to end.
//!
//! WHAT THE REGIME IS. scat's outer Newton runs over `θ = [ρ, log σ², log(ν−3)]`
//! inside a box. Fit it to data that is NOT heavy-tailed and ν is unidentified:
//! its axis heads for the upper bound of 10 (ν ≈ 22029, i.e. Gaussian) and its
//! curvature goes NEGATIVE — the score has no interior optimum in that direction.
//! Both things then go wrong at once, and n = 66 with k = 12 makes the ρ ridge
//! flat enough to expose them:
//!
//!   1. the axis pins at the bound and its clamped-away step throttles the global
//!      per-axis cap shrink, so the axes that CAN move crawl at 1/20th speed;
//!   2. once concave, Newton's `-g/|H|` on it is ~0.02 per iteration against a
//!      distance of 2, so the loop marches ~100 iterations to a point that is
//!      known in closed form.
//!
//! Both ended in `NotConverged` at the 200-iteration cap, which used to DISCARD
//! the fit — `RuntimeError: solver did not converge after 200 iterations (last
//! grad norm = 5.646e-2)` from a single-smooth scat fit that 0.13.1 fit fine.
//!
//! WHERE THE MECHANISMS ARE PINNED. Precisely, at unit level, in
//! `src/outer/step.rs::tests` — `a_pinned_axis_does_not_throttle_the_live_ones`
//! reproduces the throttle arithmetic outright, and the `concave_bound_jump`
//! tests pin the jump rule. These tests are the end-to-end complement: they check
//! that a whole `scat` fit in this regime comes back usable, and they are the ones
//! that would catch a driver that stops calling those rules.
//!
//! Fixtures: generated here, deterministic (an LCG + Box-Muller), shaped after the
//! fit that surfaced this — n = 66, k = 12, a mild signal on a ~1e5 response
//! scale, light-tailed noise. No customer data.
